- Ability to select any json file 
- Ability to validate and load JSON file. In the case where format is invalid, app to show error message.
- For simple fields such as strings and integers the user can enter a new value and save the changes to the original file.
- For fields which contain nested structures or arrays the application will display each of those fields in a small multiline textbox which canâ€™t be modified.  It should do the same if the json file contains just an array.
